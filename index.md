### What is it?
The database is a collection of articles, news stories, social media posts, and links to projects of different kinds. 

It runs on the open-source bibliographic software [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org). If you are new to it, you might want to look at the instructions and documentation below.

### What's in it?
The database is organised into six main folders:
1. Websites with "introduction to Palestine" resources.
2. Book recommendations on Palestine. 
3. Web resources on Israel’s involvement in repression outside of Palestine.
4. Web resources on Palestinian solidarity movements around the world.
5. Web resources to the BDS movement and the people doing this work.
6. Web resources on reporters, analysts, journalists, writers on Palestine working on the ground and beyond.

You can browse it through these categories, dozens of thematic tags, or simply search through it.
