## What is Olive Tree SB?
**[Olive Tree SB](http://sblisesivdin.github.io/biscuit)** is a collection of resources for learning about Palestine, put together by Academics for Justice in Palestine in Santa Barbara, California. 

## How do I use it?

We have curated a few **[introductory resources](#introductory-resources-palestine-101)** below that are a great place to start. If you would like to go further, we also maintain an ever expanding shared **[database](#full-database)** of articles, news stories, social media posts, and links to projects of different kinds, which you can access here too.
