## What is Olive Tree SB?
*Olive Tree SB* is a collection of resources for learning about Palestine, put together by Academics for Justice in Palestine in Santa Barbara, California.

## How do I use it?

We have collected some [resources to start with](/learn), depending on how much time you have to learn about Palestine. If you would like to go beyond this, we also maintain an ever expanding shared list of [further resources](/resources): books, articles, news stories, social media posts, and links to projects of different kinds, which you can access here too.
