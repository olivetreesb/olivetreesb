# Welcome
## What is Olive Tree SB?
**Olive Tree SB** is a collection of resources for learning about Palestine, put together by Academics for Justice in Palestine in Santa Barbara, California. 

## How do I use it?

We have curated a few **[introductory resources](#introductory-resources-palestine-101)** below that are a great place to start. If you would like to go further, we also maintain an ever expanding shared **[database](#full-database)** of articles, news stories, social media posts, and links to projects of different kinds, which you can access here too.

## How can I contribute?

### What is it?

### What's in it?
The database is organised into six main folders:
1. Websites with "introduction to palestine" resources.
2. Book recommendations on Palestine. 
3. Web resources on Israel’s involvement in repression outside of Palestine.
4. Web resources on Palestinian solidarity movements around the world.
5. Web resources to the BDS movement and the people doing this work.
6. Web resources on reporters, analysts, journalists, writers on Palestine working on the ground and beyond.

You can browse it through these categories, dozens of thematic tags, or simply search through it.
